## [Assignment06 pdf](https://github.com/deja-monet/IntroToProg-Python-Mod06/blob/main/Monet_Deja_FOP-Su2022_Assignment06.pdf)
This document details my strategy for completing this assignment. I completed this assignment in Jupyter Lab and edited the completed .ipynb script in order to create a working .py file that could be called with the "python" command. The Jupyter Lab file must be called with the "ipython" command.
